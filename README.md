# FreenectTD
FreenectTD is an open source TouchDesigner implementation of the [libfreenect](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect) C++ wrapper, aimed at macOS users who don't have a way to use the official Kinect OPs in TouchDesigner.

## Installing
FreenectTD relies on libfreenect and libusb to run. They have both been embedded in the plugin since version 0.2.0, to make the installation easier and aid portability.

[Download the latest build from the releases tab](https://github.com/stosumarte/FreenectTD/releases/latest), unzip and copy `FreenectTD.plugin` to TouchDesigner's plugin folder, which is located at `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Derivative/TouchDesigner099/Plugins`. You might need to show hidden files by pressing `⌘+⇧+.`.

⚠️ macOS may prevent the plugin from loading after download due to security quarantine flags. To fix this, open Terminal and run:

`xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine ~/Library/Application\ Support/Derivative/TouchDesigner099/Plugins/FreenectTD.plugin`


Now, you should be able to run TouchDesigner and find FreenectTOP under the "Custom" OPs panel.

## Usage
By default, FreenectTOP outputs RGB data. To get a depth map, you must use a Render Select TOP and reference index 1 instead of index 0.

### Examples
Example .toe project files are provided in this repository, under the "toe_examples" directory.

## FAQ
### Which features does FreenectTD support?
Currently, RGB and Depth image streaming are supported, as well as tilt control from the TOP's properties panel. No more features (such as microphone or LED control) are currently planned to be implemented.

### Which devices does FreenectTD support?
Only 1st gen Kinects are supported. Model numbers are 1414, 1473 and 1517.

![Kinect for Xbox 360 (1414/1473)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2e3090d-9e72-45d2-9e9c-8439cfc2b3a8)
![Kinect for Windows (1517)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb58beb9-3e5e-49be-8a4a-f5074fd8f723)



FreenectTD has currently been tested only with a 1414 model (Xbox 360), but it should work regardless since all these models should be compatible with libfreenect.


### Will this ever work on Kinect V2?
It's not currently planned, and it would require an almost complete rewrite since it would need to interface with libfreenect2. 
I recently acquired a couple of V2 models though, and another plugin may be coming from me later this year.
If you feel like it, feel free to fork this repo and build on it!

## Credits
A very big thank you goes to libfreenect developers, who made a great work by creating a way to unofficially interface with Kinect devices on macOS and Linux.
